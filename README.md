# Bellabeat User Behavior Analysis
Exploratory analysis of smart device usage data to generate marketing and product insights.

## Business Context
Bellabeat is a wellness technology company seeking to improve user engagement and retention through data-informed marketing and product decisions.

## Objective
Analyze smart device usage data to identify behavioral patterns and translate them into actionable insights.

## Data
- Fitbit smart device usage data (33 users)
- Daily activity, sleep, and step metrics
- April–May 2016

## Key Insights
- Physical activity shows a moderate positive correlation with calories burned (r ≈ 0.59)
- Users spend the majority of their day sedentary, indicating opportunity for movement nudges
- Nearly half of recorded nights fall below recommended sleep duration
- Activity follows predictable daily time patterns

## Recommendations
- Reinforce real-time activity feedback to encourage consistency
- Introduce gentle inactivity nudges
- Position sleep insights as a core engagement feature
- Align notifications with user activity rhythms

## Tools
- R (tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate)
  
## Notes
This project focuses on behavioral insight generation rather than predictive modeling.
